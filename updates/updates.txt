TwainSave version changes

1.3.1

- Address issues with some TWAIN devices not behaving correctly when showing the
  device's user interface (UI), or did not start scanning when no user-interface 
  was selected.  For user-interface, this includes devices that had unresponsive 
  UI control buttons, for example a "Scan" button didn't start the scanning process.

- Fixed issue with --noconsole not closing out the running twainsave process.

- Add --devicelist option that returns a JSON list of all the TWAIN devices.
  Use this command instead of --details if you want to know the device names that are
  available instead of getting a complete detailed listing of each device.
